.Sh NAME
.Nm radnsd ,
.Nd IPv6 DNS configuration daemon
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfw

.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon that extracts DNS configuration from IPv6 router
advertisments and configures the system's resolver. It aims to
conform to RFC6106.
.Nm
is useful for clients on an IPv6 network that does not provide DHCPv6
service, but does have routers configured to provide DNS resolver and
domain search list information.
.Pp
Sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the process causes it to dump its database
to the logging destination.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Enable debugging.
.It Fl f
Prevent
.Nm
from becoming a daemon (foreground mode).
Warning messages are generated to standard error
instead of
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl w
Write directly to
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf.
This is useful if the
.Xr resolvconf 8
utility is  not available, but is likely to conflict with other programs
that write to this file, such as
.Xr dhclient 8
By default,
.Xr resolvconf 8
is called to manage the resolver configuration.
